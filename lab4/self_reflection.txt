All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I think that making the resize function was pretty hard so I felt good being able to do it

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I think my addlast method was pretty inelegant and kind of clunky so the way that the staff described it made it a little more elegant.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: How to correctly create the constructor, it was very hard and difficult to understand.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would try and do the array size function differently to try and make it a little less clunky and more elegant.
